# Retroactive Rewards

{% hint style="info" %}
Using mSOL before September 30th 2021 made you eligible for retroactive MNDE rewards. \
Those rewards have now been fully distributed and all unclaimed rewards were sent back to the treasury. Details for each wave can be downloaded below.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## :abacus: Calculation

The MNDE claims are based on the following calculation: mSOL or LP holding at the end of each day (00:00 UTC) during the specific period outlined in the relevant wave. That means that the rewards will be proportional to how much mSOL or connected LP you had (including mSOL related LP at ecosystem partners for some waves).&#x20;

### Wave 0&#x20;

:calendar\_spiral: **Period**: Devnet

****:question:**Who**: All users who helped us on devnet.

:abacus: **MNDE allocation**: 100k MNDE distributed equally to all devnet participants.

****:information\_source: **Claim date**: starting 11/4/21, 12:00 UTC.

### Wave 1&#x20;

:calendar\_spiral: **Period**: From 2nd of August to 9th of August.

****:question:**Who**: mSOL holders (first 100k staked SOL), LPs in the Marinade unstake pool (mSOL/SOL pool on Marinade).

### Wave 2&#x20;

:calendar\_spiral: **Period**: 10th of August to 25th of August

:question:**Who**: mSOL holders, LPs in the Marinade unstake pool + ecosystem integrations. This means that if you have used mSOL in other protocols, you might also be eligible for retroactive rewards.

:abacus: **MNDE allocation**: 3,415,328 MNDE.

:information\_source: **Claim date**: 11/18/21, 16:00 UTC.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
For wave 2 of MNDE distribution, we implemented a claim cap of 50k MNDE per account. Any MNDE above the cap were redistributed to the remaining eligibile accounts. We took this decision to soft-limit a whale impact and empower a larger group of individuals a bit more.
