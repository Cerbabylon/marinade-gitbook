## Milestones

As more SOL gets staked in Marinade in a decentralized and open way, Solana becomes more secure and everyone wins. To reflect that, liquidity mining adds a stretch-goal like mechanic of TVL milestones.&#x20;

When certain TVL milestones of SOL staked is reached, the next week of liquidity mining will feature a bonus MNDE allocation, added to the next week's liquidity mining pool to be distributed. Each milestone can be hit only once.&#x20;

The total budget to be distributed via the milestone program is 80M MNDE. The TVL levels and respected bonus MNDE allocations are:&#x20;

* 3M SOL staked = 3,500,000 MNDE bonus allocation ✅&#x20;
  * reached in week 1, distributed over week 2&#x20;
* 5M SOL staked = 7,000,000 MNDE bonus allocation ✅&#x20;
  * reached in week 1, distributed over week 2&#x20;
* 10M SOL staked = 7,000,000 MNDE bonus allocation
* 20M SOL staked = 14,000,000 MNDE bonus allocation
* 50M SOL staked = 17,500,000 MNDE bonus allocation
* 100M SOL staked = 31,000,000 MNDE bonus allocation
