# List on Marinade's DeFi page

## Process

If you are a protocol that integrated mSOL (in any imaginable way), you can be displayed on our [DeFi page](https://marinade.finance/app/defi).

Here are the steps to follow:&#x20;

* Join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/6EtUf4Euu6).
* Send a message to c2yptic#5964, JJ - Marinade#7183 or Cerba#1454 indicating the protocol you work with and your desire to be added to the DeFi page.&#x20;
* A specific channel in our Discord will be created for you, where one of our developper will be able to help you throughout the process.
* You will be given access to our repository and an example to follow in order to integrate your protocol yourself.&#x20;
