# Bot operations

The bot takes care of multiple operations, mainly updating mSOL price, delegation strategy and matching staking with unstaking orders.

These operations are completely permissionless, meaning that anybody can run them so that the program is always operational.&#x20;

If you want to run the computation of our bot for yourself, you can find it on this repository: [https://github.com/marinade-finance/staking-status](https://github.com/marinade-finance/staking-status)
