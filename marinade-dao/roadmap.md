# Roadmap

## Marinade's grand plan

#### "Build a foundation for a shift of everyday life to crypto by ‘democratizing’ blockchain security and bridging the gap between people and finance."

&#x20;Marinade was started with the ultimate goal to help onboard more people into crypto by:

* Offering the simplest and most pleasing to use liquid staking solution in the Solana ecosystem.
* Seemlessly integrating with other protocols in the DeFi ecosystem to create high inter-operability.
* Drastically improving the security of the network via decentralization.

## Goals

* All SOL staked on Solana, securing the network.&#x20;
* mSOL as the ultimate unit of account in the Solana DeFi ecosystem.&#x20;
* Facilitate the onboarding of the next 1 billion people to crypto.

### Targets

* 1/2023 - **Total Value Locked**: 30M SOL / **Annual Recurring Revenue**: $30M / **% of circulating SOL staked**: 15%
* 1/2025 - **Total Value Locked**: 100M SOL / **Annual Recurring Revenue**: $100M / **% of circulating SOL staked:** 25%

{% hint style="info" %}
Marinade also monitors the evolution of some key metrics, with the aim of improving them over the years:

* (SOL) Total value locked
* (%) mSOL to total staked SOL
* (#) contributors
* (#) validators
{% endhint %}

## Roadmap
