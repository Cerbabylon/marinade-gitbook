# ðŸ›  Marinade DAO

## What is a DAO?&#x20;

A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is an on-chain system designed to give the governance of a protocol back to its users. By owning the governance token, you own rights to vote on decisions taken for the future of the protocol. These governance rules are applied on-chain, by smart contracts, where all information is freely accessible.&#x20;

On-chain governance tools are still being built on Solana, but **Marinade has already created its DAO**. It functions off-chain (on our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/6EtUf4Euu6)) for now, and on-chain tools will be integrated as soon as they are available.

## Marinade DAO

First of all, Marinade DAO (mDAO) is an open kitchen. **Radical transparency** is one of our main values; anyone can come and see what we are cooking. You are also free to contribute to the project (and get rewarded!), just join our Discord and engage with us.&#x20;

The other way of joining the mDAO is by owning MNDE tokens. These are governance tokens that will represent your voice on the future of Marinade.&#x20;

Marinade has already onboarded community members to actively contribute to the project. By joining our mDAO, you can participate in the discussions, voice your opinion on any matter, and vote on important decisions, but you can also get involved in the development of our kitchen.

## Values

When doing what we're doing, we come back to the following set of values:

1. **Radical transparency**. At Marinade, we believe in the blockchain movement. Technological transparency with data and learnings accessible to everyone with an extremely quick feedback loop is rapidly speeding up the evolution of humankind. That's why we are gradually opening up everything from financials, system dashboards, and ongoing projects to the code base. Open-source rules the world. This also applies to our social layer - we welcome every open, honest individual to join our kitchen.
2. **Be a no-ego doer**. Marinade was born out of a merger of different teams aligned with the same vision - to fully democratize liquid staking on Solana. We're thinking about what's best for Marinade's vision, putting egos aside while always trying to find the best solution no matter who brought up the idea. We also prefer to go and get stuff done. Deliver. Perfect is the enemy of good, quite often.
3. **Work smarter, not harder**. You know the story about the woodcutter being so busy cutting the trees that he does not have time to sharpen his saw? Well, we put focus on sharpening the saw, improving the way we do things at Marinade step by step. We aim to work the system, not to be a fire killer.
4. **Collaboration over competition**. We believe in positive-sum games in a collaborative environment. We've reserved enough space in Marinade to meet and welcome more bright minds that will join us to cook collectively in our open kitchen. We prefer this over wasting resources on keeping things secret and trying to outsmart others.
